<h2>TRUE BILL?</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Much</span> ingenuity has been expended in trying to
prove that <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> was a lawyer, and, amongst
other passages in his writings, the two first lines of the
Sonnet which commences&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;When to the sessions of sweet silent thought</p>
<p>I summon up remembrance of things past,&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>may be thought to indicate that he possessed legal
acquirements. Has it, however, occurred to the editors
and commentators, that these lines are capable of another
interpretation, and may be considered to add a new item
to our scanty knowledge of <span class="smcap">Shakspeare's</span> personal history,
if we take the more probable view, that when he
penned them he had in his mind's eye those familiar
Tribunals&mdash;the Quarter Sessions&mdash;to which, it may be
whilst residing in the Metropolis, but most undoubtedly
after his retirement to Stratford, he would be summoned
in the capacity of Grand Juryman?</p>

<hr />

<h2>SOUP AND SERMON.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Morning Post</i> records an interesting case of&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;<span class="smcap">Supper To Convicted Felons.</span>&mdash;On Tuesday evening a supper was
given to one hundred and fifty convicted felons by <span class="smcap">Ned Wright</span>, the well-known
converted burglar, at the Mission Hall, Hales Street, High Street,
Deptford. The candidates for tickets of admission were compelled to attend
the night before the supper and give an account of themselves to prove that
they really were convicted felons, and by the sharp and close questioning of
<span class="smcap">Mr. Wright</span>, about fifty were refused tickets as impostors.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>The fifty impostors who were fain to palm themselves off as convicts
for the sake of a supper, must have been poor knaves indeed.
These supernumeraries, for whom there was no seat at the table of
Society, constitute a spectacle on the stage of life which it may be
painful to some people and pleasant to others to contemplate from
the dress circle. It is too probable that this Capital contains very
many more of these Esaus, as they might be called if they had
anything of a character so valuable as a birthright to dispose of on
<span class="smcap">Esau's</span> terms, with the small extras undermentioned:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;The recipients of this Charity were a very motley crew, and ranged in
years from six up to fifty. They were each served with a quantity of soup and a
bag containing bread and a bun, after which <span class="smcap">Mr. Wright</span> addressed them in
his own peculiar manner, being listened to with marked attention.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wright</span>, we may suppose, took care to preach in a &quot;tongue
understanded of the people&quot; who constituted his hearers, and
accordingly delivered a considerable portion of his discourse in the
language which our great-grandfathers called thieves' Latin. A
sermon in slang, however, would, perhaps, be more curious than
edifying. Let us hope that <span class="smcap">Mr. Wright's</span> may possibly have had
the effect of converting the guests who would once have been his
pals from the error of their ways, formerly his own. Such, at least,
appears to have been his laudable intention:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;A large number of ladies and gentlemen interested in such work attended
and gave the benefit of their advice and co-operation. In the course of the
evening <span class="smcap">Mr. Wright</span> announced his intention of taking under his patronage
a number of the boys then present, who might be desirous of earning an
honest livelihood, and furnishing them with money and clothes to make a fair
start in life.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>It would rejoice both ourselves and our benevolent readers to
know that the acceptance of this offer by a considerable number of
<span class="smcap">Mr. Wright's</span> young friends may be the commencement of a career
of good living, wherein they will very soon attain to better fare
than a quantity of soup, a bag of bread, and a bun, quite good
enough as that is for convicted felons, besides being peculiarly suitable
as precluding any necessity for knives and forks chained to the
table.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Lawyers and Lunatics.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> hardly will Judges, for the most part, admit the plea of
insanity in exculpation from a charge of murder! How readily are
they wont to entertain it as a reason for setting aside a will! How
right they are in either instance! Suppose a maniac is hanged as a
man of sound mind, his execution serves just as well, for the purpose
of example, as it would if he were. But my Luds would make a
mistake on the wrong side by misdirecting Jurors to determine
insanity to have been sanity in a case wherein a lunatic might possibly
have misdisposed of property.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Serious Affair.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A most</span> determined act of self-inflicted torture has recently
caused a considerable sensation in a fashionable quarter of Town.
A lady, young, lovely, and accomplished, with troops of friends,
and all that makes life enjoyable at her command, was detected
deliberately &quot;screwing up&quot; her face!</p>

<p>O the Temple of Untrammelled
Thought.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, May 10,
1882.</i> Heard a transcendent
oration from
Althea Duxmore on
&quot;Dogmas and Dogmatics.&quot;
Bi-monthly
levy for the expenses
of the Temple. Stephanotis
Hewleigh
and I the eleemosynars
who collected in
the new Septentrional
Vestibule, where the
men are put. Their
united contributions
amounted exactly to
half a Victoria!
Several dimes in the
salver. The new Act,
limiting the personal
expenses of Adult
Males, may have
something to do with
this. Shall move in
the Saloon for Returns
showing the
working of the Act.
Alfred nowhere to be
seen in the Vestibule;
perhaps detained by
the children's toilette.
In the afternoon at
the new Museum
of Natural History
opened this Spring,
at Kensington. The Galleries crowded. Several of us, including Professors Sara
Sabina Thewes and Caroline Gostrong, delivered extemporary lectures on the
animals; the men very attentive. In the evening to St. Paul's; heard the new
organist, Charlotte Bach Stopmore, Mus. Doc. The Cathedral a blaze of splendour
with the Tyndaluminospectric light. We Women have yet something to
learn in physical science.</p>

<p><i>Monday, May 11.</i> Received, by appointment, a deputation from the electors
of New Marylebone, inviting me to candidate that District at the next General
Election. Mrs. Admiral Stenterton, and Miss Lydia Boss Wolloby, the dominant
spokeswomen. Spread out my views on the Husbands' Regulation Movement,
the Cigar-Tax, the Compulsory Inspection of Men's Clubs, and the
Repudiation of the National Debt. All satisfactory, and I agreed to retire from
Jutley. Deputation luncheoned with me. No place kept for Alfred, who had to
sit at a side-table.</p>

<p>To the Club (the Gynecium), and flashed a long private cryptogram to the
Chairwoman of my Committee at Jutley. Dined at the Club. After dinner in
the Fumitory. Took a Cabriole to the Saloon. Driver an extortionist; but
I knew the exact distance, to the tenth of a kilometre. Saloon debating the
Juries Exemption (Women) Bill. Spoke, I think, with sensation. The venerable
Earl of Hughenden came in as I was perorating. Alfred, in the Gentlemen's
Gallery, in tears. I wore my black velvet and point lace pelerine, with the
diamond star he gave me after the Jutley election. That tiresome, tedious,
insufferable Hannah Longbore (how South-West Suffolk stands her so long
I cannot imagine) prosed on against the Bill, and sided with the Men, but we
fidgeted her down at last. She had on that old crimson satin which has seen
three sessions at least! Maiden speech from Marian Spray&mdash;pretty enough.
Forget what Men spoke. Mrs. Leader Donne, the lovely (!) and accomplished
Member for Ironville, closed the debate. Rather too great a parade of learning;
positively she quoted Lycophron in the original! But we all see through Mrs.
Leader's schemes&mdash;she means the Educational Under-Secretaryship, when Bella
Falayse goes to the Upper Saloon as a Peeress <i>jure suo</i>. Home by Twelve.
Alfred sitting up for me. What a resource that <i>Hortus Siccus</i> is to him!</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, May 12.</i>&mdash;Card from Madge Bassingham, R.A., for her Inaugural
Praelection, as Pigmentary Professor at the Royal Academy. Could not go,
as I was engaged on a Committee at the Saloon&mdash;Metropolis Extension, Brighton
Annexation Bill. Dined with Mrs. Abraham Skrooley, M.P. Woman's party.
The Constantia exquisite. Discussed over our cigarettes the arrangements for
the approximating Women's Cosmopolitan Congress. Alfred and one or two
other Men came in the evening.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, May 13.</i> Not well in the morning. Flashed for Dr. Martha
Walkingholme. She was detained at the Spleen Hospital, but her partner,
Harriet Chamomile, came and applied the Magnetic Detonator to my spine and
the backs of my ears. Instant relief. In the evening at the Biennial Banquet
of the Indigent Widowers' Pension Fund at Willis's. The Duchess of Middlesex
in the chair. After dinner the Indigent Widowers circuited the tables, and
attracted much attention by their neat and respectable
appearance. I proposed the toast of &quot;The Gentlemen.&quot;
Alfred responsed, and for a wonder did <i>not</i> break
down.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, May 14.</i> Gave Cook a lesson on the harp
before breakfast. Sitting in the Library reading Mill's
&quot;Woman Triumphant,&quot; when my electric alarum rang.
Message from Oxford from my youngest sister, Bianca,
to say that she had that instant been elected Fellow of
Carlyle College. Three hundred and ten competitors.
Tremendous examination, lasting three weeks. Bianca's
thorough domination of Russian, Japanese, political
economy, statistics, aërostatics, electrology, hygiene and
thermapeutics, gave her the victory. Hope some day
she will stand for the University. For joy I took a
half holiday. (Left Alfred quite happy with his silkworms.)
Gymnastic relaxation at the Palaestra on
the Expanse at Hampstead. Then by Tube to Dover.
Tunnelled over to Paris, shopped, and back by the six
rapid. Might have stayed later for we could not make
a Saloon: seven short of the legal Quorum, a hundred&mdash;so
many Members (men, I need hardly say) absent at
the Great International Croquet Tryst at the Crystal
Palace. Passed an hour pleasantly at the Diatomaceous
Society, of which I have lately been balloted a Fellow.</p>

<p><i>Friday, May 15.</i> Busy all the morning preparing my
oration on the &quot;Wise Sayings of Wise Women in all
Countries and Epochs,&quot; for the Congress. (Interrupted
twice by Alfred, who had got the housekeeping accounts
and the washing-book into a fearful muddle.) Great
meeting at 3'30 in Emancipation Hall, to welcome Mrs.
Hale Columbia Spragg, the first female President of the
United States. She has transited the Atlantic to attend
our Congress, but can only be present at this evening's
Inauguratory, as she must be in New York again before
sundown to-morrow. Went to the Saloon, but it immediately
adjourned, on the motion of Mr. Theodore
Stuke, to enable the Lady Members to festinate to the
Congress. Immense success. Fifteen hundred Delegates
from every country in the world processed down the
Hall, and then arranged themselves by Continents on
the gilded dais. Twenty-five thousand women computed
to be present in the Spectatorium. Our distinguished
champion and unflinching Hegemon, Amelia Smackles,
assumed the presidential throne. Incessant coruscations
of enthusiasm, which culminated when a black sister
moved the fourteenth resolution, demanding the total,
immediate, and unconditional transfer of all menial
labour from Woman to Man. Did not get home till
1 p.m. Left my key behind me, so obliged to rouse
up Alfred, who was in bed, in great distress at the loss
of one of his canaries, and had forgotten to order my
stout. Vexatious!</p>

<p><i>Saturday, May 16.</i> Dejeuned at the Constellation
Hotel with dear Amelia, to meet Mrs. President Spragg,
Chief Justice Roberta Cokestone (from Liberia), the
Lady Warden of the Cinque Ports, the Lady Mayoress,
the Mistress of the Mint, and other forward Members
of the Congress. The President left us at noon. She
would balloon over to New York in five hours and a
half. Quiet dinner at Richmond in the evening. Only
Amelia, two of the elder Sisters of the Trinity House,
and the Delegates from Germany, Turkey, Greece, and
China. Bianca joined us unexpectedly from Oxford,
and introduced her bosom friend, the Professor of
Anatomy, Henrietta Stott Trawsell. Delightful promenade
by the river before dinner. Met Alfred fishing
for gudgeon.</p>

<hr />

<h2>MORE EDUCATION-FIGHT.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Punch</span> shudders to see the Metric question raised
again. Are we not in the thick of an Educational War
already? Will our contemporaries abstain from putting
new reasons for quarrel into the heads of fanatics.
We shall certainly have the Decimal business taken
up by Denominationalists and by Secularists. Ten
fingers point out that the natural law is one of decimals.
Also, there are ten commandments for the theologian.
On the other hand, there are twelve signs of the Zodiac:
this for nature; and twelve Apostles: this for theology.
O, please let the matter alone, and let the little boys
and girls be taught anyhow, so that they are taught
at all.</p>

<h2>CHURCH DIS-ESTABLISHMENT.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"> <a href="images/035.png"><img width="100%" src="images/035.png" alt="T" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">erminal Punch</span>,</p>

<p>Five more London
churches are to be immediately
destroyed. Down
with them! First down
with St. Mildred's, in the
Poultry. It was built by
<span class="smcap">Sir Christopher Wren</span>,
and somewhere about it
rest the remains of <span class="smcap">Thomas
Tusser</span>, who wrote the
&quot;Five Hundred Points of
Good Husbandry.&quot; Sweep
it away, and then batter
down St. Dionis Backchurch,
also built by <span class="smcap">Sir
Christopher</span>. There are
monuments in it to the
great benefactor to the
Bodleian Library, and to
the founder of the Saxon
Lectureship in St. John's
College, Oxford. Who
cares? St. James's, Aldgate,
is to be demolished:
'tis enough that Hebrews
chiefly abide around that
fane, and need it not.
Out with St. Martin of
Outwich; it hath stood
less than a hundred years, and though it was consecrated by <span class="smcap">Bishop
Porteus</span>, and holdeth fine old monuments, conserved through three
centuries, away with it! Lastly (for the present) turn this pictured
clown's pickaxe upon St. Anthony's, or St. Antholin's, Sise
Lane. That, too, was the work of the Architect of St. Paul's, and
sundry be the memories which our old dramatists and our <span class="smcap">Walter
Scott</span> have hung on &quot;St. Anthing's.&quot; It is very meet and right
that the old City churches should all go, few persons now abiding
near them on Sunday, and religion being a thing for Sunday. <span class="smcap">Sir
Christopher's</span> Cathedral, as it is also a Mausoleum, will probably
be spared until some railway or tramway shall want the site.</p>

<h2>ORGANS OF OFFENCE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Thursday last week a modification of the American Gatling
Gun, called the &quot;British Mitrailleuse,&quot; was tried for the first time
at Woolwich. The following is a description of this benevolent
machine:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;It consists of ten barrels hooped together and revolving in the centre, and
fitted into a carriage like that of an ordinary field-gun, which, at a short
distance, it greatly resembles. The barrels and cartridges are similar to
those of the Henry-Martini rifle&mdash;in diameter .45 in.; the cartridge-cases
being of brass, and bottle-necked.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>Tremendous, however, as may be the execution which this weapon
is capable of doing among a flock of soldiers, authorities are of
opinion that, &quot;like small arms generally, it must give way to rifled
ordnance.&quot; On its trial:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Indeed, most of the Royal Artillery Officers present seemed to think that the
machine-gun can never stand against Artillery, even if its delicate machinery
did not become disarranged by mere musket-shot.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>So that a comparison is suggested to those who read, that when the
&quot;British Mitrailleuse&quot; is made ready and placed in position&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;A handle like that of a street-organ, and fixed at the side of the trail, is
then turned at any degree of rapidity required, and the barrels load and fire
until the supply of cartridges is exhausted, which takes about five minutes
under favourable conditions.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>One is led to compare the British Mitrailleuse with the Italian
Grinding Organ, and to question if the latter be not, of the two, the
more offensive instrument.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Corrigendum.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> antiquity of the Athanasian Creed being now shown to be a
myth, the date being that of <span class="smcap">Charlemagne</span>, would it not be well,
before the Prayer Book is finally revised, that the correction should
be made? For it will take many a year to abolish the belief that
St. Athanasius drew up the document, especially as divers theologians
think nothing of some four hundred and fifty years of what
they imagine to have been the Dark Ages. &quot;Commonly (but
absurdly) called the Creed of St. Athanasius&quot; is a line that, in a
century or so, might have an effect upon the less un-intelligent.</p>

<hr />

<h2>A PROFESSION'S UNION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Bas-Unterwald, according to the <i>Swiss Times</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;Strikes are becoming the fashion in the higher circles of society. The
physicians of this peaceful Arcadia have united and struck work, demanding
an increase in their fees. The Laudrath, however, refuses to entertain their
claims, and advises a strike of the patients as the best answer to the physicians'
demands.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>There was a time when a strike of patients anywhere would have
been attended with a very great decrease of the rate of mortality.
There is reason to suppose that in the present improved condition of
medical science such would not be the case. The strikers, struck
with fever, or other grave illness, would probably be struck down
in rather alarming numbers.</p>

<p>What justification of a medical strike there may be in Switzerland
hath not appeared, but in this country there is, in some quarters,
not a little. The ridiculously low wages, not to say salary, begrudged,
not to say granted, to Medical Officers by many Poor-Law
Unions would amply warrant the establishment of a Professional
Union corresponding to a Trades' Union, and consisting of sons of

strike well enough without committing any outrage on the Non-Unionists,
or Knobsticks. There would be no need for the Doctors
on strike to picket, and waylay, and beat the others on their road to
the Workhouse, or across country to the recipient of out-door relief;
and they could do without rattening them and filching away their
physic, stethoscopes, and surgical instruments. In dealing with
unworthy members of an honourable Profession, capable of underselling
their brother-chips, the practitioners forming the Union
would require to have recourse to no proceedings associated with
Sheffield; they would find it quite sufficient to send outsiders and
recusants of co-operation in a strike to Coventry.</p>

<h2>OMINOUS INDEED!</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> England, that reads the newspapers, will have felt the shock
of a truly&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;<span class="smcap">Terrific Explosion</span>&mdash;Yesterday evening an explosion of a frightful
character occurred at <span class="smcap">Gladstone's</span> Cartridge Factory, Greenwich Marshes,
by which a large number of girls have been seriously injured.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>Considering for what Constituency the <span class="smcap">Premier</span> is Member of
Parliament, the majority of people cannot but be, momentarily at
least, startled and taken aback by the information in the first place
that <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> has a Cartridge Factory in Greenwich Marshes, and,
secondly, that it has been the scene of a terrific explosion. Nor
certainly are they likely to be re-assured by the further intelligence
that:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;A few weeks ago the Government seized 365 cases of ball cartridge,
each containing 20 lb. weight, which had been manufactured by <span class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone</span>
for the French Government during the late war.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>The obvious suggestion conveyed by this statement is, that there
has occurred not only a terrific explosion in the borough of Greenwich,
but also a not less alarming blow-up in the Cabinet.

<h2>ELEGANT ADVERTISING.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you like, read this advertisement from the <i>Christian World</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
CO-PARTNER WANTED, by a highly respectable Man, aged 30,
member of Spurgeon's. A gentlemanly person required, a believer
with about £50, and who can travel.&mdash;Address, &amp;c.
</blockquote>

<p>Hm! In the first place a gentlemanly person would not wish to
hear his partner talk in that exceedingly curt way of their minister
and his flock. &quot;Member of Spurgeon's.&quot; &quot;One who regularly
attends the ministrations of the Reverend <span class="smcap">C. H. Spurgeon</span>, B.M.&quot;
would be more gentlemanly language. Nextly, &quot;a believer with about
£50&quot; reads rather Mammonish. It suggests that a sceptic with about
£75, or a positivist with about £100, would not be unacceptable.
Thirdly, &quot;who can travel.&quot; Who <i>can't</i> travel with about £50? <span class="smcap">Mr.
Cook</span> will give you a return-ticket for the Pyramid for about that.
Fourthly, the &quot;and&quot; is abominable English. We wish our

<h2>SAD ALTERATION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Dramatist has led us to think that &quot;Music hath charms to
soothe the savage breast,&quot; but the &quot;Heavenly Maid&quot; is not so
&quot;young&quot; as she was when <span class="smcap">Congreve</span> wrote, and increasing years
seem to have changed her mood and spoiled her temper. What
other conclusion can we come to, when we find in an article on
&quot;Music&quot; in one of the newspapers, in some comments on the performance
of a young lady on the piano at a Monday Popular Concert,
the disquieting statement that she &quot;left her mark as usual on the
audience, the music, and the piano&quot;? It is some little relief to
find the writer adding that &quot;this last was more than once punished
severely;&quot; as it is a fair inference to draw, that whatever the
sufferings of the piano may have been, the music, and, which is far
more important, the audience, escaped with only one assault.</p>

<p>The Managers of the Monday Concerts should consider, before it is
too late, whether they are not endangering the well-deserved popularity
of their agreeable entertainments, by allowing performances
which would seem to have rather too striking an effect upon the
hearers.</p>

is so specially characteristic of the Ermine that &quot;sober as a Judge&quot;
is an adage; not, indeed, because Judges are supposed not to

<h2>EVENINGS FROM HOME.</h2>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, with <span class="smcap">Masters Sandford</span> and <span class="smcap">Merton</span>, at the <span class="smcap">Queen's
Theatre</span>, to see &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii.&quot;</i></p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> Pray, Sir, what and where was Pompeii?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> It was, my dear <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, a Roman municipality,
full of eligible villas, pleasantly situated in the immediate neighbourhood
of Mount Vesuvius, and within easy reach of the sea. It
was &quot;a place to spend a happy day,&quot; and &quot;there and back&quot; from
Naples formed one of the chief excursions, at a very moderate rate,
for the middle classes of Neapolis.</p>

<p>They had just commenced this instructive and entertaining conversation,
when the curtain rising discovered to their eager eyes as
artistic and effective a scene (with the exception of stationary
painted groups, whose fixed attitude strangely contrasted with the
movement of the actors in front of them) as it had hitherto been
their lot to behold.</p>

<p>As the play went on, <span class="smcap">Harry</span> requested permission of <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>
to ask a question.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Did you not tell us, Sir, that the &quot;e&quot; in Pompeii was long?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> Indeed, <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, I did.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And did you not also tell us that one of the purposes of a
theatrical exhibition, such as this is, is the advancement of education
among all sorts and conditions of people?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> You are again correct, and truly I begin to perceive
the drift of your remark. Therefore let me tell you that had any
Eton boy said Pomp&#0277;ii, instead of Pomp&#0275;ii, he would speedily have
been taught the force of an <i>argumentum</i> addressed, as was one of
<span class="smcap">Horace's</span> Odes, <i>ad puerum</i>.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Surely too, Sir, a diphthong is long; so that the name
<i>Ap&oelig;cides</i> should not be rendered Appy-cides, as if the name were
an unaspirated pronunciation of <i>H</i>appy Cides.</p>

<p>To this <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> replied that doubtless these honest folks had
cogent reasons for their mode of pronunciation, with which he
advised <span class="smcap">Harry</span> to become acquainted, before taking upon himself
to pronounce an unmitigated condemnation of them.</p>

<p>&quot;You will now perceive, <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, during the
performance of the Third Scene of the First Act, &quot;that the crafty
<i>Arbaces</i> is anxious to entice the sentimental young gentleman, <i>Appy
Cides</i>, to partake of the repast with him.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> But, Sir, surely the young man's objection to accept the
invitation of the Egyptian, must arise from a sense of politeness on
his part, which, as there is nothing edible on the table, I fancy,
except one plate of fruit, will not permit him to deprive <i>Arbaces</i> of
even a portion of a dessert that has, evidently, been only ordered
for one.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> Indeed, <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, I think you are right, and had
<i>Arbaces</i> thought of it, I am certain he would willingly have extended
his hospitality to a bag of nuts or some cakes of gingerbread.
But you must remember that <i>Appy Cides</i>, or, as he seems to me,
<i>Un-'appy Cides</i>, is only the pupil of <i>Arbaces</i>, and does not appear
at his tutor's table until dessert-time.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> If I were there I would go and eat everything, and then
I would dance with one of the young ladies.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> I am sorry, <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, that you are of that mind; and
at another time&mdash;for I perceive that the good people in the pit, by
their repeated cries of hush, and by the direction of their attention
towards us, wish rather to hear the dialogue on the stage than my
discourse, which is, after all, of a personal and private character&mdash;at
another time, I was about to say, I will read to you an instructive
story on greediness, entitled <i>Chares and the Convulsive Tailor</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tommy</span> looked on at the piece very sulkily for some time, being,
indeed, intent upon the antique cups and goblets and upon the
plate of luscious fruit which he had already noticed. But on seeing
that neither <i>Arbaces</i> nor the sentimental young gentleman partook
of anything that was provided for them, he began to have high
opinion of their breeding, and before the scene was finished was
heartily sorry for his error, and applauded all he saw and heard
with increasing rapture and delight.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> You may, indeed, evince your gratitude to these
worthy people, since they have done all in their power to entertain
and instruct us. And, indeed, where all is done so vastly well, I
know not what to commend most, whether the sonorous voice and
dignified scoundrelism of that twice-crushed Priest of Isis, the
iniquitous and unprincipled <i>Arbaces</i>, played by the remarkably
upright and conscientious actor, <span class="smcap">Mr. Ryder</span>; or whether the
gentle pleadings of the blind <i>Nydia</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Miss Hodson</span> is the young
lady's name, my dear <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, and I have no doubt she saw and
appreciated your boyish enthusiasm&mdash;or the bearing of <span class="smcap">Mr. Rignold</span>
throughout a remarkably difficult and most trying part. But,
<span class="smcap">Harry</span>, what is your opinion?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Why, Sir, I am very little judge of these matters, but I
protest that I feel mightily indebted to those clever gentlemen,
<span class="smcap">Masters Gordon</span> and <span class="smcap">Harford</span> (I had well-nigh slipt into the
error of saying <span class="smcap">Masters Merton</span> and <span class="smcap">Sandford</span>) for the scenery
which has so admirably served to illustrate this play. I am sorry
that <i>Appy Cides</i> was killed, as, having become a Christian, there
would, I am sure, have been every opportunity open to him as an
estimable young curate of evangelical proclivities.</p>

<p><i>Tommy</i> (<i>during the cleverly arranged Amphitheatre Scene,
Act IV.</i>) I am glad to see, Sir, that in this scene where we have so
much to admire, the tumblers&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> These, my dear <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, represent the gladiators.
And you must remember that on the stage, where every combat has
to be carefully arranged both as to the number and fashion of the
blows given and received, and as to who shall be, and who shall not
be the conqueror, the contest of two determined champions, or
rather of two champions whose course has been previously determined,
cannot fail to be of a most thrilling and exciting character.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> O, Sir! they have given orders to let the Lion loose.
O, Sir! the Lion is coming!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I do not believe that all these fine gentlemen and ladies
would remain so still if there were, indeed, a Lion approaching.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> The Lion, my dear <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, is a native of both India
and Africa. When they are hungry, they kill every animal they
meet, and will even devour little boys&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here poor <span class="smcap">Tommy's</span> trepidation was increased to such an extent
that he would have quitted his seat and the theatre, but for the
sudden entry of the traitor <i>Calenus</i>, whose charge of murder brought
against his master, the wily <i>Arbaces</i>, instantly distracted everyone's
thoughts from the coming of the expected monster.</p>

<p>Both <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> and <span class="smcap">Harry</span> were loud in their praises of the
dramatist who had contrived to arouse in the breasts of the spectators
such emotions of fear, by the absence of the Lion, as could
scarcely have been equalled by his formidable presence.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, &quot;on reflection, I am led to consider
the chiefest part in this piece to be the Lion's share in it. He is
spoken of at the commencement of the play, he is often alluded to
throughout, and the bare mention of his name sensibly electrifies
the spectators on and off the stage. From the very first we are
incited to expect his appearance. He has not to roar to make himself
dreaded. He has not even to be present, either on or off, the
scene.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> This device is, in my humble judgement, worthy of high
commendation in the play-wright, who has thus evinced his reverence
for the words of the immortal <span class="smcap">William</span>, and whose plan is
in cordial agreement with <i>Bottom's</i> opinion on this very matter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page040" id="page040"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
which, my dear <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, as you are as yet unacquainted with the
works of <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>, I will repeat to you. &quot;<i>Masters</i>,&quot; says
<i>Bottom</i>, &quot;<i>You ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in a lion
among ladies is a most dreadful thing, for there is not a more fearful
wild fowl than your lion, living</i>.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tommy</span> was so forcibly struck by this adroit application of a famous
passage from the plays of <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>, that he determined, on the
first opportunity to read all these dramas through from beginning to
end. And having already set himself to the study of astronomy and
mechanics, solely in order to make himself as proficient in the
art of applicable illustrations as was his friend <span class="smcap">Harry Merton</span>,
<span class="smcap">Tommy</span> now found that he had at least one hour of the day fully
occupied.</p>

<p>On their return from the theatre <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, ever anxious for
the improvement of both his young friends, commenced reading
to them the story of <i>The Magistrate and the Elephant</i>; but, seeing
that both his young friends were fast asleep in their chairs, he lit
his chamber-candle and retired for the night.</p>

<p>On entering his room somewhat suddenly, a pair of boots,
artfully placed so as to rest on the door, which had been standing
ajar, descended on his head; and the next instant, on his
taking one step forward, he came in contact with a stout string, so
skilfully fastened, as not only to throw him sharply on the floor, but,
being cunningly connected with the fire-irons and the washing-stand,
it brought down these articles also with a great crash and
much confusion. Before he could arise from his painful position,
<span class="smcap">Tommy</span> and <span class="smcap">Harry</span> had rushed up-stairs to render to their revered
preceptor what assistance was in their power. Being questioned as
to the hand they had had in this strange affair, <span class="smcap">Master Tommy</span>,
with becoming modesty, acknowledged that it was he who had
devised the scheme. &quot;And,&quot; said he, &quot;I protest I think it is no
inadequate representation of what must have been the consequence
in several houses during the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the
<i>Last Days of Pompeii</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>So saying, both the boys withdrew themselves rapidly from their
beloved tutor's apartment, and locked themselves into their own
rooms. Soon after this, they were all in a sound slumber, which
lasted until a late hour on the following morning.</p>

<h2>VINDICTIVE TEUTONS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a good deal of talk in France about revenge to be taken
one of these days upon the Germans for having repelled and beaten
their invaders. In the meanwhile, according to the <i>Post</i>, those
barbarous Germans are trying to revenge themselves, in their heavy
way, on the enemies who have been twitting them with stealing
clocks and watches, by an&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;<span class="smcap">Important Restoration of Specie.</span>&mdash;<i>The Courier de Meurthe et
Moselle</i> announces that the six millions of francs which had fallen into the
hands of the German troops after the capitulation of Strasburg, and belonging
to the Bank of France, are about to be restored to that establishment through
its branch bank at Nancy.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>This, of course, is a practical sarcasm at the expense of a nation
represented by some of its orators and statesmen as having been
aggrieved by being forced to restore pictures and works of Art which
the First <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> and his gangs in uniform had pillaged from
their neighbours. It is obviously meant to suggest an odious comparison
between those who make restitution of even lawful plunder
in hard cash, and those others who grumble because of having been
compelled to replace Art-treasures actually stolen, and that in some
cases from friends. This is clumsy German satire to be sure, but it
tumbles down pretty heavily for all that on the heads of them that
shouted &quot;À Berlin!&quot;</p>

<h2>PIG-AND-BARGAIN-DRIVING.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Eastern Morning News</i>&mdash;what a pretty name&mdash;why not the

<blockquote>
<span class="smcap">Wanted</span>, a GROOM and Coachman, and to assist the Gardener.
Wages, 18s. per week to commence with, to be advanced 1s. per year
for every year he remains. Must understand horses and pigs, and be able to
drive one, or a pair.
</blockquote>

<p>We do not think the wages too high. A celebrated Oxford Don,
who could make Greek verses as fast as mill-wheels strike, yet who
was not so ready with ordinary English, beheld, from the top of a
coach, a drover striving to guide some pigs along the road. Wishing
to be conversational, the Don observed to his neighbour, &quot;A difficult
Animal to drive is a Pig&mdash;one man&mdash;a good many&mdash;very.&quot; Here,
observe, were the materials for a pleasing remark, but they needed
arrangement. He was right, however. Pigs are difficult to drive,
and the Yorkshire advertiser who wants a man able to drive one
pig, or a pair, is right in offering him the above noble rise in wage.
Correspondents will abstain from vulgar suggestions about a pig and
a &quot;hog&quot;&mdash;we don't understand them.</p>

<h2>LONDON GOLD DIGGINGS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear</span> Old England! well may one exclaim, on reading in the
<i>Daily News</i> a statement such as this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;<span class="smcap">Value of Land in Lombard Street.</span>&mdash;A piece of land adjoining the
Lombard Exchange, in Lombard Street, has been sold for £9000, or about
£19 4s. 6d. per foot super.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>It used to be affirmed that London streets were paved with gold,
and, by the side of the above, the story hardly seems beyond one's
power of credulity. Land worth nineteen pounds per foot must be
wellnigh as good as gold to its fortunate possessor, and the man who
owned an acre of it would hardly need to emigrate to any other
diggings. Assuredly, to any <i>Fortunatus</i> who owns much land in
Lombard Street, London may be looked on as the true Tom Tiddler's
Ground.</p>

<hr />

<h2>The New Judge.</h2>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> hears that <span class="smcap">Lord Chief Justice Cockburn</span> (one of
our most accomplished Latin writers) intimated to the <span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>
that the appointment of the new Judge for the Queen's Bench was
a <i>Sine Quainon</i>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>WANTED&mdash;SIMPLICITY.</h2>

<p>Mr. Punch</p>

<p>Is the English language a thing to be ashamed of? I put
the question, because in a weekly literary journal, printed and published
in London in the mother tongue, I have just read, not without
some rubbing of eyes and much mental bewilderment, the following
singular announcement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;<span class="smcap">Institution of Civil Engineers.</span>&mdash;The <span class="smcap">Emperor of Brésil</span> was
elected an Honorary Member.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>I have never heard that Brazil has become a French possession,
and I am positive that the Institution of Civil Engineers is not in
Paris, but in Great George Street, Westminster. Why, then, Brésil?
Crack this Brazil-nut for</p>

<p class="author">Yours, unaffectedly,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Jno. Smith</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Can fish talk? I ask this second question, after seeing that
another periodical publication contains an article with the heading,
&quot;Perch Prattle.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<h2>We Can't See It.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the odd kinds of consolation under affliction, the last
suggestion seems to <i>Mr. Punch</i> the oddest. We are mourning the
demise of the no-horned Infant Hippopotamus in the Regent's Park,
and we are told to be cheerful, for a two-horned Infant Rhinoceros
has gone to Madrid. The doctrine of compensations was never
pushed much further, even in a Scotch sermon.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Platonic Politics.</h2>

<p>Plato gives the best reason why Woman's Rights should be conceded,
and Women be admitted to power. Listen, Dears, &quot;Rulers
should have Personal Beauty.&quot; Kiss ums own old <i>Punch</i>.</p>

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
